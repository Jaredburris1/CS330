Graphics Course

1. How do I approach designing software?
    What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
    What design process did you follow for your project work?
    How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
    
    - New design skills I have crafted are mainly all about designing shapes and graphics with opengl and some math. I also learned a LOAD about file handling and how things work together especially with including certain files and trying to bring certain files or images into the program. The design process I followed mainly stayed on track with what I was learning in class whenever I learned a concept I would do my best to integrate that concept into my project or assignments before moving forward. Tactics from my design approach can be used in the future by adding on to my design process and building upon it further and further the more I work on graphics and OpenGL.
  
2. How do I approach developing programs?
    What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
    How did iteration factor into your development?
    How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
    
    -I tried out multiple different strategies while working on my 3D scene and the one that happen to be the best is the one that takes the longest amount of time and that is to take as many good notes as possible and writing out what code you're going to write like psuedocode so you can tweak everything on paper before turning it into code. Iteration factored into my development because every week started turning into the same thing hours and hours of watching videos on thursday and working on everything friday through sunday. I certainly started off really slow and after really understanding how high leveled this course I started making a plan and my approach got better and better weekly to eventually get to my projects completion.
    
3. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
    How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
    How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
    
    -Graphics and visualizations have given me extensive knowledge to help me further in my educational pathway and further in my professional pathway. Being able to write code that can create images is something I have wanted to do since I started and now having some of this knowledge is insane to me. In my educational pathway the next couple classes I have until I graduate might require some graphics to move further! For my professional side the amount of opportunities in software engineering are endless and I am absolutely positive that I'll be using graphics in the future while creating games or just regular programs.
